#### 1. Be Clear and Specific

Clarity and specificity are essential for getting accurate and relevant responses.

Example: "Give me a brief overview of deep learning"

#### 2. Define the Structure or Format

Specify if you want the response in a particular format, like a list, comparison, or bullet points.

Example: "Summarize the benefits of deep learning in bullet points."

#### 3. Set a Role or Context

Assign the model a role to get responses in a specific tone or from a particular perspective.

Example: "You are a travel guide. Suggest an itinerary for a 3-day trip to Tokyo."

#### 4. Ask for Examples

Request examples to clarify abstract concepts or complicated ideas.

Example: "Explain the concept of deep learning with a real-world example."

#### 5. Define Constraints or Limitations

Limiting the scope can lead to more concise and relevant responses.

Example: "Describe the benefits of deep learning in under 100 words."

#### 6. Request Step-by-Step Instructions

For processes, guides, or explanations, ask for a step-by-step breakdown.

Example: "Explain how to step up a deep learning project in Python step by step."

#### 7. Prompt for Research or Citations

Ask the LLM to back up its claims with references or details.

Example: "What are the current theories on deep learning? Provide sources if possible."
