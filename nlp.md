### What is NLP
Over the past decade, the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has seen remarkable advancements, driven by breakthroughs in machine learning, deep learning, and the availability of large-scale datasets. 

NLP = Natural Language Understanding (NLU) + Natural Language Generation (NLG)​

- NLU is a subfield of NLP that focuses on the machine's ability to understand and interpret human language. It involves comprehending the meaning, context, and intent behind the words and sentences.​
- NLG is another subfield of NLP that involves generating human-like text based on data or prompts. It is the process by which a machine produces text that is coherent, contextually appropriate, and often indistinguishable from text written by a human.​

### NLP Tasks
The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is vast and encompasses a variety of important tasks. 
Here are the top 10 most critical tasks in NLP, each of these tasks plays a crucial role in advancing the capabilities of NLP systems, contributing to more natural and effective human-computer interactions.

- NLU Tasks

**1. Text Classification:** <br>
Involves categorizing text into predefined categories.
Applications include spam detection, sentiment analysis, and topic categorization.

**2. Named Entity Recognition (NER):** <br>
Identifies and classifies named entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations) within text.
Essential for information extraction and understanding the context of content.

**3. Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS Tagging):** <br>
Assigns parts of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a sentence.
Fundamental for syntactic analysis and many other NLP tasks.
Example: In "John gave Mary a gift," "John" is a noun, "gave" is the verb.

**4. Coreference Resolution:** <br>
Determines when different expressions in a text refer to the same entity.
Important for understanding the context and maintaining coherence in text processing.
Example: In "John went to the store. He bought milk," recognizing that "He" refers to "John."

**5. Dependency Parsing:** <br>
Analyzes the grammatical structure of a sentence to establish relationships between "head" words and words which modify those heads.
Essential for understanding syntactic structure and meaning of sentences.


- NLG Tasks

**6. Text Summarizing:** <br>
Produces a concise summary of a longer text document.
Useful for generating quick insights from large volumes of text.

**7. Paraphrasing:** <br>
Rewrites a sentence or paragraph in a different way while retaining the original meaning. 
Example: Rewording "The dog is playing in the park" as "A dog is having fun in the park."

**8. Machine Translation:** <br>
Translates text from one language to another.
Key for breaking language barriers and enabling global communication.
Example: Translating "Hello, how are you?" from English to Spanish as "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"

**9. Speech Recognition:** <br>
Converts spoken language into text.
Critical for applications like voice assistants, transcription services, and accessibility tools.

**10. Question Answering (QA):** <br>
Develops systems that can answer questions posed in natural language.
Utilized in chatbots, virtual assistants.
